# What's the scope of this plugin?
This plugin adds multiple Hay Day game functionalities to a Minecraft Server. I created this plugin for my own server, so there might be some functionalities that you should change if you want to implement it to your server.
# Are any other libraries necessary?
No. This plugin is auto-sufficient. No libraries such as ProtocolLib are necessary, but obviously it doesn't create any conflict with other libraries.
# How can I install the plugin?
I have not and I'm not planning to create a stable release for this project for two main reasons:
1. It is constantly updated and it is not actually finished yet
2. It is highly suggested to edit the code to match your server scopes
Due to this, to implement this you need a Java compiler (personally I use Intellij IDEA), compile the project and add it to your server in the /plugins folder.
# Other notes
Please consider that this plugin is created to be used in an Italian server, so any String is written in Italian and I've not implemented any automatic translation features because I don't need to.
